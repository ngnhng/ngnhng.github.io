        <p>
          Large systems invite heroics. Small systems invite steady care. I find
          myself reaching for the latter more and more, not as a constraint but
          as a gentle constraint that frees me from complexity tax.
        </p>
        <p>
          A small system is legible at a glance. It reminds you of its shape,
          rewards you with quick feedback, and asks for only the simplest
          rituals to keep it healthy.
        </p>
        <p>
          My favorite projects are the ones that fit in my head: a single page,
          a clear purpose, a few rituals repeated over time. The scale is
          modest, but the impact is wide.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is the quiet joy: a system that stays friendly to the future
          version of you.
